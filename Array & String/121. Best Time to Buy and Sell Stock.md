## Problem

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## The Way of Thinking

/*

max_profit = max(p[j] - p[i])
          0 <= i < j <= n - 1

buy: prices[i], min{prices[k]}, k <= i
sell: prices[j], max{prices[k]}, k >= j

*/

1. maintain min price from an array

   ```java
   [7,1,5,3,6,4]
   min_value = min(min_value, cur);
   ```

2. maintain max profit based on current price and min price in history

   ```java
   max_profit = max(max_profit, cur - min_value)
   ```

Why does it works?

- we can calculate the min price because buying day always before selling day

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int min_price = Integer.MAX_VALUE;    
        int profit = 0;
        for (int num : prices) {
            min_price = Math.min(min_price, num);
            profit = Math.max(profit, num - min_price);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```

end.
